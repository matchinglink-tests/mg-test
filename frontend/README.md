#Matching link mortgage test
This Angular front end provides a user interface for navigating the data from the Spring Boot REST endpoints.
When running the angular application, the user is shown an overview of the mortgages. This is a table with for each mortgage a row containing the mortgage summary.

Clicking a row of this overview table shows a field containing the full details of the mortgage, including a link to the page with cash flow information.

The cash flow information page shows a long table with a row for each mortgage payment, showing both the date of the payment and the amount.
